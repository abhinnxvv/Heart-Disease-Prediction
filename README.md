# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various medical attributes. It utilizes machine learning algorithms such as K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to perform classification tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [heart.csv](heart.csv). It contains the following attributes:

- **age**: Age of the individual (in years)
- **sex**: Gender of the individual (0 for female, 1 for male)
- **cp**: Chest pain type (0 for typical angina, 1 for atypical angina, 2 for non-anginal pain, 3 for asymptomatic)
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl)
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved (in bpm)
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (in mm)
- **target**: Presence of heart disease (0 for no disease, 1 for disease)

## Algorithms Used
- **K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier**: A simple and effective algorithm that classifies instances based on the majority class of their k nearest neighbors.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier**: A supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis. It works by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into two classes.

## Files Included
- **heart.csv**: The dataset containing medical attributes and labels.
- **heart_disease_prediction.py**: The Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- **README.md**: The documentation file you're currently reading.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `heart_disease_prediction.py` script.
4. Follow the prompts to input your medical information.
5. The script will predict the likelihood of heart disease based on the provided information and display the results.

## Acknowledgments
- The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
